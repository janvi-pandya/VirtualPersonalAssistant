  - ~30 minute per session.

# My take-away from the requirement:
+ I will be using MERN stack to develop the web-tool.
+ Justification:
  - Based on brief research, after development of this web-tool if in future it has to be transitioned into a mobile-app, using MERN would make it easier.
+ I will be focusing more on developing responsive UI and keeping it as compact and dynamic as possible.
